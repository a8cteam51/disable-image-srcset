# Disable Image Srcset

This plugin gives you the ability to disable the srcset attribute on specific images.

## What is the srcset attribute?

The srcset attribute is a way to provide multiple image sizes for a single image. This is useful for responsive images, where the image size can be adjusted based on the screen size. For example, a small image can be used on a mobile device, and a larger image can be used on a desktop device.

## That sounds great, why would I want to disable it?

The srcset attribute can be useful, but there are times when you may want to disable it for a specific image.

Some examples:

* You want to always show the highest quality image, regardless of the screen size.
* There is a conflict with another plugin or theme.
* You want to use a different plugin to handle responsive images.

No matter what reason you have for wanting to disable the srcset attribute, this plugin gives you the ability to do that.

## How do I use this plugin?

This plugin adds a new checkbox to the image editor. You can check this box to disable the srcset attribute for a specific image.
